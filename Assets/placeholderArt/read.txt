this whole folder is meant to be deleted

This is a placeholder tile map so josh can try to make procedural generation

The plan: 
-make a few skeleton types of rooms
    + possibly some variants of each types
- algo generates each type of room in a semi-random location
- entries are connected by (shortest?) pathing algo
    ?check success using djikstras
